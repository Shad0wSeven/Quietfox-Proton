# Quietfox for Proton
Quietfox release for Proton, upgrades and improvments from myself, and from the Lepton project

## [Original](https://github.com/coekuss/quietfox)

## Designed to make Firefox feel better once again.

After proton, things broke, themes were lost, and tons of bad stuff happened. Thankfully, the quietfox theme was honestly minimally affected, and I decided to adapt it to use with my own system.

This theme was designed with Compact mode in mind, although Normal and Touch density can still be used.

## Known Issues

### UNTESTED ON WINDOWS!!!

This theme is untested on Windows (I only have MacOS and Linux), if you encounter any errors, please open an issue!

### Transparent Themes

These screenshots were taken using the [Google Chrome Light Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-chrome-light/) theme, transparent themes such as Alpenglow look really bad:

A fix is being worked on, but until this message is removed, it  has not happened yet :(
