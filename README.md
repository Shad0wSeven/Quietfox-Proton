# Quietfox for Proton
Quietfox release for Proton, upgrades and improvments from myself, and from the Lepton project

## [Original](https://github.com/coekuss/quietfox)

## Designed to make Firefox feel better once again.

After proton, things broke, themes were lost, and tons of bad stuff happened. Thankfully, I fixed my favorite theme.

This theme was designed with Compact mode in mind, although Normal and Touch density can still be used. (If you're a masochist)

## Known Issues

### Transparent Themes

Transparent themes such as Alpenglow look really bad:

Unfortunatly, I can't find a way to fix this for now, although look for it in an upcoming release :/


### Dark Themes and Themes that have a differnet Tab color from the bar

Check Releases, and look at [v1.1](https://github.com/Shad0wSeven/Quietfox-Proton/releases/tag/1.1-alpha)!
